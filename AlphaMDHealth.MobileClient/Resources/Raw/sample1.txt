Project Description

Our .NET MAUI project aims to create a versatile file viewer application that allows users to seamlessly view different types of files within a single app. The app is designed to be user-friendly and capable of displaying a wide range of file formats, making it a one-stop solution for various document and media needs.

Key Features:

File Type Support: Our app supports various file types, including text documents, PDFs, Word documents, images (JPEG, PNG), HTML content, Excel spreadsheets, videos (local files), and even YouTube videos.

User Interface: The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can choose from a selection of buttons representing different file types, making it straightforward to view specific content.

WebView Integration: We utilize the power of the WebView control to render and display file content seamlessly. The WebView is versatile and can handle HTML, PDFs, videos, and more.
